Thanks for downloading django-gravatar!

To install it, first use subversion to check out the source code:

    svn checkout http://django-gravatar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-gravatar

Now, link the included ``gravatar`` directory to your pythonpath.  On Debian 
variants, it would look something like this.

    sudo ln -s `pwd`/django-gravatar/gravatar /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

To use it with a Django installation, first place 'gravatar' in the INSTALLED_APPS
tuple of your settings.py file like so:
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'gravatar',
    )

Here is sample usage in a template.

    {% load gravatar %}
	{% gravatar blogs.author 40 %}

In the previous example, a gravatar will be displayed for the specified author
at a size of 40px square.  The second argument is optional and if not supplied
the gravatar image will be 80px square, the default gravatar image size.

In addition to supplying a user object, you can also provide a username as a
string.  For instance:

	{% gravatar 'jtauber' %}

If supplied in this fashion then the user object is loaded based on the
username information.

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and Django later than
0.96. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from 
http://www.djangoproject.com/.
